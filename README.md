# GEM 2019 
Repository for tutorial, notes, and Jupyter notebooks. Primarily a resource developed for the 2019 NSF-funded Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) workshop.

# Installing Python
A brief description of installing Python on Windows, Mac, and Linux can be found [here][1].

# Jupyter Notebook
Many of the tutorials will use [Jupyter Notebook][2] - a web application that allows you to run Python from your browser. If you want to follow along in the tutorials make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If you have installed Anaconda you Jupyter Notebook will also be installed. If you've only installed Miniconda then install Jupyter Notebook with:

```
conda install jupyter
```

From the command prompt you can open Jupyter using:

```
jupyter notebook
```

A quick tutorial can be found [here][3].
